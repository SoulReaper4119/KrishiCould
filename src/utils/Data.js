      "Neem coated urea is created by utilising two best things available. First the urea created by technology from Air & Natural gas and second products from natureâ€™s gift i.e. neem plant. Neem has proven Nitrification inhibition properties and hence slows down the release of nitrogen from urea and makes available nitrogen over a longer period with minimum loss of nitrogen thereby increasing nitrogen use efficiency. At our Hazira and Shahjahanpur Plants, Neem coated urea is produced by uniformly coating neem oil on prilled urea during the manufacturing process.",
